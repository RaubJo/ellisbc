By \"The Holy Bible\" we mean that collection of sixty-six books, from Genesis to Revelation, which, as originally written does not only contain and convey the Word of God, but IS the very Word of God. <br /> 2. By \"inspiration\" we mean that the books of the Bible was written by holy men of old, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, in such a definite way that their writings was supernaturally and verbally inspired and free from error, as no other writings have ever been or ever will be inspired.",
